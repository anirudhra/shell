# vimfiles

Vim configuration

Windows: put these in /Program Files/vim directory
UNIX/Linux: put these in ~/.vim directory; move 'colors' directory to ~/.vim with no vimfiles directory

Rename dot_vimrc to .vimrc for UNIX/Linux and \_vimrc for Windows. For Windows, edit \_vimrc to comment UNIX specific lines and uncomment Windows specific ones.
